# Description
A gesture recognition system. This system allows a user to choose different color markers and then depending on the relative position of markers call different system functions. In this project we can handle a mouse . This project was tested using a game built in unity game engine. 

MotionControl.cpp can be extended to make the system recognize more gestures and call more functions.
